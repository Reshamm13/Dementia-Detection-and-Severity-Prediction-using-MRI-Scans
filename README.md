# Dementia-Detection-and-Severity-Prediction-using-MRI-Scans
Dementia impacts millions globally, with cases rising. This study uses CNNs to classify dementia severity (no, very mild, mild, moderate) via MRI scans and Grad-CAM to highlight affected brain regions. This interpretable approach aids diagnosis, enhances understanding of progression, and boosts confidence in predictions.
