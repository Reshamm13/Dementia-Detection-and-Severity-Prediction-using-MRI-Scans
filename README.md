# Dementia-Detection-and-Severity-Prediction-using-MRI-Scans
Dementia impacts millions globally, with cases rising. This study uses CNNs to classify dementia severity (no, very mild, mild, moderate) via MRI scans and Grad-CAM to highlight affected brain regions. This interpretable approach aids diagnosis, enhances understanding of progression, and boosts confidence in predictions.

## Project Overview and Goals

Millions of individuals worldwide suffer from dementia, including Alzheimer's, and the number of cases is predicted to rise. Effective intervention requires accurate and timely diagnosis. However, conventional approaches frequently use simple deep learning or machine learning models to categorize or forecast dementia, which are unable to pinpoint the precise brain regions impacted or provide an explanation for their conclusions.

This study overcomes these constraints by employing **Grad-CAM** for visual explanations and **CNNs** for classification, making it particularly helpful for medical imaging.

### Objectives

- Use **Deep Learning** concepts like CNNs and Grad-CAM to detect and predict the severity of dementia using MRI scans.
- Classify dementia into four classes:
  - Class 0: No Dementia
  - Class 1: Very Mild Demented
  - Class 2: Mild Demented
  - Class 3: Moderately Demented
- Offer region-specific analysis by identifying key brain regions influencing predictions.
- Improve confidence in model predictions and enhance interpretability.

## Importance of Grad-CAM in Medical Diagnosis

In modern medicine, medical imaging technologies such as MRI provide useful diagnostic information. AI technologies based on deep learning architectures have shown remarkable results in analyzing medical images. However, the "black-box" nature of deep neural networks limits their adoption in clinical settings.

**Grad-CAM** (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) addresses this limitation by generating heatmaps that explain classification results. These visualizations highlight the contribution of input features to predictions, helping medical professionals trust and interpret the models' decisions.
